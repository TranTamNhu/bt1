    <h1>This is <i>still</i> a motherfucking website. </h1>
    <p>And it's more fucking perfect than the last guy's.</p>
    <div>
        <h2>Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit.</h2>
        <h4> 7 fucking declarations.</h4>
        <p>That's how much CSS it took to turn that <span style="color: blue;text-decoration: underline;">grotesque pile of shit</span> into this easy-to-read masterpicece. It's so fucking simple and it <i>still</i> has all the glory of the original perfect- ass website.</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Shit's <em>still</em> lightweight and loads fast.</li>
            <li> <i>Still</i> fits on all your shitty screens</li>
            <li> <i>Still</i> looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
            <li> The motherfucker's <i>still</i> accessible to every asshole that vistis your site</li>
            <li> Shit's <i>still</i> legible and gets your fucking point across</li>
        </ul>
        <h3> And guess what, motherfucker:</h3>
        <p> You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how.</p>
    </div>
    <div> 
        <h2> Let it breath</h2>
        <p> Look at line 1 and 2 of some shitty website building.Assuming they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash--pick a minimum line-heighr: 1.4 for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that...piss off.</p>
        <p> If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that?<br>
        Yes? What a shitty book.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2> A little less contrast</h2>
        <p> Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it doen a bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice #EEEEEE if I wasn't so focused on keeping declaration to lean 7 fucking lines.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2> Size matters</h2>
        <p> I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close to 16px or more. Smaller type work well for print, not the screen</p>

    </div>
    <div>
        <h2> Line-width, motherfucker</h2>
        <p> Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's 200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentence of your worthless dribble.</p>
        <h4> Yes, This is <i>also</i> fucking satire, you fuck</h4>
        <p> I love what the creator of<span style="color: blue;text-decoration: underline;"> this site's inspiration</span> did. What I'm saying is that it's sao, so simple to make sites easier to read. Website are broken by default, they are functional, high-oerforming, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. you and all the other web designers out thers need to make them not total shit.  </p>
